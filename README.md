# File Tree 

### File Tree is a cli that will generate files and folders for you automatically.

To run it simply type:

```
file_tree <Feature Name> <File extension>
```

It will look for a `config.json` file in your project root and generate the files according to it. 

For creating your own `config.json` file please chek the example [here](https://github.com/AliAkberAakash/file_tree/blob/main/config.json)

### The project is still a work in progress. If you want to contribute please email me at ali852609@gmail.com
