##  Open-source to-do list pull request template for GitHub Pull Request template
Please go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).


3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.

    b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    c. Describe your changes.

    d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
